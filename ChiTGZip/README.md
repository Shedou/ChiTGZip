ChiTGZip:

Portable experimental GUI for statically compiled TAR/GZip/7-Zip archivers.


System requirements for ChiTGZip:

- x86 or x86_64 CPU
- Desktop Linux with Glibc 2.17+ (since Ubuntu 13.04 and others)
- OpenGL 2.1+ support


Pre-compiled utilities can be found in the "Utils" folder.

Executable files have the standard extension “.exec”.
Due to limitations of Linux executable files, the icon is located as a separate file in PNG format.
